# Push Your App to GitHub

*Created by Alyson La, [@taxaly](www.twitter.com/taxaly)*

## Things you need before you get started

* Download Git - git.org (how does one know if they have git?)

* Sign up for a free GitHub account - github.com

* Download the [GitHub for Mac](www.mac.github.com) or [GitHub for Windows](www.windows.github.com) native client (optional)

**COACH:** Talk a little about git, verison control, and open source

There are a couple of different ways to use git and push your app to GitHub - using the terminal (aka the command line) or using a native client like GitHub for Mac or GitHub for Window. Using a native client verus the command line is a personal preference. Some people find git complicated and prefer a native client to make using git easier however the commmand line prompts are good to know since most open source projects provide instructions using the terminal. Choose what works for you! 

## Push your app to GitHub using the command line

On your GitHub profile click "new repo" - give it a name (example: rails-girls) and brief description. Choose public and click "initialize this repository with a README"

**COACH:** Explain what a repository is and talk a little about READMEs and markdown.

In the command line (make sure you are cd'd into your railgirls folder) use the prompt:

(need to use the highlight feature here)

`git init`

This initializes a git repository in your project 
Initialized empty Git repository in Users/you/railsgirls/.git/


*Note:* If you've already done the [Heroku guide](/heroku), then you've already initialized a git repository & you can move on to the next steps. 

Then type in:

`git add .`

This adds in all of your files & changes so far to a staging area.

**COACH:** talk about the difference between git add. and the other command you would need to add changes one at a time. (What's this command again?)

Then type:

`git commit -m "first commit"`

This commits all of your files, adding the message "first commit"

Then type: 

`git remote add origin https://github.com/username/rails-girls.git` 

This creates a remote named "origin" pointing at the GitHub repository you just created

You can copy and paste the link from your GitHub repository - click the clipboard icon next to the http:// url to copy

Then type:

`git push origin master`

This sends your commits in your "master" branch to GitHub

Congratulations your app is on GitHub! If you want to continue making changes and pushing them to GitHub you'll just need to use the following 3 commands:

`git add .`
`git commit -m "type your commit message here"`
`git push origin master`

Check out what's next below!

## Push your app to GitHub using GitHub for Mac/Windows

Open your GitHub for Mac/Windows native client

Drag and drop your rails girls folder from your local folder structure into where it says *my repositories*.

It you don't already have git initialized, you'll be prompted to create a new repository. Click yes and a git repository will be created for you!

**COACH:** Explain what a repository is and talk a little about READMEs and markdown. 

## todo: 

* how does one add a README.md file? 
* fill in instructions on how one syncs to a remote git repository?

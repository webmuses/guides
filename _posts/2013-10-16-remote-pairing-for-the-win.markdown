# Rails Girls Remote Pairing Tutorial

## Why is Remote Pairing so great?

First things first, what is my motivation for sharing this?  If you are reading this, you are already aware of the power of Rails Girls.  In case you didn't know, let me give you a few facts.  Rails Girls is an organization that introduces women to web application development using Ruby on Rails.  For many women around the world, it is a **powerful, emotional experience** that shows them that they can create something new for the Web and that they have support of other women who extended their privledge to them.

I said "around the world", didn't I?  Indeed, Rails Girls is on **every continent** and in 130 plus cities!  So there is part of the promise of Rails Girls -- that women, around the world, who need some way of lifting themselves up out of possibly dire circumstances and thru study and application of what they've learned, get the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow -- a high paying job where they are respected for creating something.

## But seriously, why is Remote Pairing so great?

Remote-pairing is so great because people who can benefit from people who would coach them are not always near to them.  I know this because I was a Rails Girls Summer of Code Coach who lived in Virginia, while the team I coached lived in London and Pennsylvania.  If it weren't for remote pairing, I'd have to get on a plane or drive twelve hours just to show how to write "hello, world" example app!

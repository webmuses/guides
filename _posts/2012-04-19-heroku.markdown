### Get Heroku

Follow steps 1 through 3 of the [quickstart guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart) to sign up, install the toolbelt, and login.

### Deploying your app

#### Updating our database

First, we need to get our database to work on Heroku, which uses a different database. Please change the following in the Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sqlite3'
```

to

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'sqlite3'
end
group :production do
  gem 'pg'
end
```

Run `bundle install --without production` to setup your dependencies.

#### Version Control

We need to add our code to version control. You can do this by running the following in the terminal:

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

__COACHES__: This would be a good time to talk about version control systems and git.

#### Deploying

We need to create our heroku app by typing `heroku create --stack cedar` in the terminal and see something like this:

```
Creating evening-sky-7498... done, stack is cedar
http://evening-sky-7498.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:evening-sky-7498.git
Git remote heroku added
```

In this case "evening-sky-7498" is your app name.

Next we need to push our code to heroku by typing `git push heroku master`

Next we need to migrate our database like we did locally: `heroku run rake db:migrate`

You can now hit the app based on the url. For this example app, you can go to http://evening-sky-7498.herokuapp.com/

# Test your app with rspec

*Created by Floor Drees, [@floordrees](https://twitter.com/floordrees)* 

Rspec is a Ruby testing framework, that describes our application's behavior in a syntax that doesn't look much like Ruby. It outputs test results in your terminal, so you'll test your reading skills as well (pun intended).

__COACH__: Talk about testing and Behavior Driven Development.

### Install rspec

For starters, let's install rspec and all of its dependencies. 
{% highlight sh %}
gem install rspec
{% endhighlight %}

Then we call
{% highlight sh %}
rspec --init
{% endhighlight %}

in our project directory. This creates `spec_helper.rb` in the spec folder, and `.rspec`.

Rubyists often use the words 'test' and 'specification' interchangeably, that's why you'll store your tests in the 'specs' folder. Save your test as `idea-spec.rb` (`<name_of_spec>_spec.rb`).

Inside that new file, write:
  
{% highlight ruby %}
require "spec_helper"
require idea
{% endhighlight %}

Next, let's describe one of our specifications
{% highlight ruby %}
describe idea do
  it "has a title" # your examples (tests) go here
end
{% endhighlight %}

In your terminal run
{% highlight sh %}
rspec spec/lib/idea_spec.rb
{% endhighlight %}

which will output that your test is pending as it's not yet implemented. 

__COACH__: Talk about googling one's terminal output.

Let's do something about that!
{% highlight ruby %}
describe idea do
  it "has a title" # yep, you can totally use 'it'
    idea = idea.new # creating a new idea 'instance'
    idea.title.should be_true # this is our expectation
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

should give you a more satisfying output.

#### Marking to-do's with tests

Yeah! To-do lists. Awesome. A nifty rspec feature is the functionality to mark certain tests as pending. 

Leaving out the `do` and the `end` in the example body, like so

{% highlight ruby %}
it "has a title"
{% endhighlight %}

will mark a test as pending. For bigger applications, where you want to tackle one test at a time, you can also add an `x` in front of an example, making it read 
{% highlight ruby %}
describe idea do  
  xit "has a title" do
end
{% endhighlight %}

or use the word `pending` in your example.

### Behavior Driven Development

Normally we would go about BDD testing in a slightly different way. Thinking about the application we want to build, we'll write down our expectations and then start building step by step, with the specifications in mind. 

We'd first write 

{% highlight ruby %}
describe idea do
  it "has a title"
    idea = idea.new 
    idea.title.should be_true 
    # or, alternatively: idea.title.should == true
    end
end
{% endhighlight %}

and only then create a file named `idea.rb` introducing the idea class

{% highlight ruby %}
class idea
attr_accessor :title
end
{% endhighlight %}

as running `rspec spec/lib/idea_spec.rb` in your terminal before you've implemented that class will throw you an error. Luckely, errors are nothing to be afraid of. Rspec errors actually help you write (the necessary) code! 

__COACH__: Talk a bit about refactoring.

Try and write tests for the follow up guides to check if you're implementing ALL the right things. 

{% highlight ruby %}
describe Attendee do
  it "tests everything"
end
{% endhighlight %}

Just saying.

Happy testing!
